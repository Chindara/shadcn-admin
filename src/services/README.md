## Folder: `services`

### Purpose

The `services` folder contains all modules responsible for handling data fetching, API communication, and shared business logic across the project. It provides a centralized location to define and manage how your application interacts with external data sources and APIs.

By organizing services in this folder, the project achieves the following benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps data logic separate from UI components, making components cleaner and easier to maintain.
2. **Reusability**: Service functions can be reused across multiple features and components.
3. **Maintainability**: Centralizes API endpoints and business logic, making updates and bug fixes easier.
4. **Testability**: Isolated service logic is easier to test independently from UI.
5. **Scalability**: As the project grows, new services can be added without cluttering the component or feature folders.

## Folder Structure

The `services` folder is structured to hold various service-related files that define how the application communicates with APIs or handles shared business logic. A typical structure might look like this:

### Note this structure is just an example!

### `SampleService.ts`

This file defines functions for interacting with a sample API endpoint, such as fetching, creating, or updating data.

### `UserService.ts`

This file could handle user-related API calls, such as authentication, user profile fetching, and updates.

## How to Use Services

To use a service, import the relevant function from the service file and call it in your component, hook, or other business logic:

```typescript
import { getSampleData } from '@/services/SampleService';

// In a React component or hook
const data = await getSampleData();
```

## Conclusion

The services folder helps maintain a clean, modular, and scalable codebase by centralizing all data and API logic. This approach ensures your application remains maintainable and easy to extend as it grows.
